  Hello, my name is Lalit and I'm a software developer. I Learn, code, experiment with Java and JavaScript.
  Currenty I'm learning ReactJS and brushing up my DSA as Java has been my main focus. I'm a tech enthusiast so you will often find me wondering 
  on tech blogs and forums. 
  So that's all about me. If you would like to talk, visit the connect section and reach out to me.
